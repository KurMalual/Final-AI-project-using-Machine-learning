# Resume Screening App

A simple web application that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to automatically screen and categorize resumes. Users can upload `.txt` or `.pdf` files, and the system predicts the most suitable **job role or category** based on the content.

## Overview

This project streamlines the recruitment process by automating the **resume screening** phase. The app processes and classifies resumes using **NLP** techniques and a **multi-class machine learning classifier**, enabling faster and more consistent candidate filtering.

### System Components

#### Training Notebook ‚Äì `resume_screening.ipynb`
- Preprocesses the data (cleaning, label encoding, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Extracts features using **TF-IDF**.
- Trains a **K-Nearest Neighbors** model with `OneVsRestClassifier`.
- Saves the trained model and vectorizer.

#### üåê Web App ‚Äì `app.py`
- Built with **Streamlit**.
- Allows resume file upload.
- Predicts job category from resume content using the trained model.

## Features

- Upload resumes in `.pdf` or `.txt` format.
- Automated screening with **instant predictions**.
- Uses **TF-IDF** and **KNN** for accurate classification.
- Clean and intuitive web interface built with **Streamlit**.
